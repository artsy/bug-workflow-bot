## Steps
- Make a `.env` file with the contents of `Slackbot bug-workflow-bot tokens` on 1Password.
- Run `yarn dev` to run the bot locally.
- Run `yarn ngrok` to expose the bot to the internet.
- Copy the first url from ngrok output, something like `https://14c3-108-54-246-210.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080`, so take the `https://14c3-108-54-246-210.ngrok.io` part.
- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps/A013FSQNV96/event-subscriptions and paste the link in the `Request URL` field, appending `/slack/events`, so in our example, `https://14c3-108-54-246-210.ngrok.io/slack/events`.
- Click `Save Changes` at the bottom of the page.
- Make sure to put the previous endpoint for Slack back in that `Request URL` field.
